### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Quentin, I am currently a Post-Doc at the University of Basel, Switzerland, working on the [Daphne project](https://daphne-eu.eu), and supervised by Florina Ciorba.
Until December 2023, I was doing my PhD with Eric Rutten and Olivier Richard at the UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes, France, on applying Autonomic Computing and Control Theory to HPC systems, and improving the reproducibility of experiments with distributed systems.


I am interested in Parallel and Distributed Computing, Reproducible Research, and Energy Efficient Computing.
